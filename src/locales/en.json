  "baselineInstructions2": "Use light pressure when drawing the line to avoid scratching or damaging the silica coating. Any scratches could interfere with the flow of solvent and the separation process during the TLC experiment.",
  "markingSamplePoints": "Marking Sample Points:",
  "samplePointsInstructions1": "Along the baseline, mark positions where the samples will be spotted. Start 0.5 cm from the side edge of the plate and mark additional points spaced evenly (~1 cm apart). Each of these marks represents where a different solution will be applied.",
  "samplePointsInstructions2": "Label these points by writing letters under the baseline to identify each sample. For example, 'A' for sample 1, 'B' for sample 2, and so on. This ensures you can track the identity of each sample during the experiment.",
  "importanceOfLine": "Importance of line",
  "baselineForSampleApplication": "Baseline for Sample Application:",

Whether you're running multiple samples on one plate or multiple plates in separate experiments, using a consistent starting point allows for accurate and reproducible results.",
  "preventsContaminationBySolvent": "Prevents Sample Contamination by the Solvent:",
  "preventsContaminationBySolventInfo": "The line is drawn above the solvent level when the plate is placed in the development tank. This prevents the solvent from dissolving the sample directly when it starts to rise through capillary action. If the sample is below the solvent line, it could dissolve into the solvent prematurely, causing smudging or mixing, and leading to poor separation.",
  "helpsSpotDetectionUnderUV": "Helps Spot Detection Under UV Light:",
  "helpsSpotDetectionUnderUVInfo": "The baseline also helps when checking the plate under UV light. After separation, you can easily locate where each sample was initially applied and trace how far each spot has moved during the experiment.",

  "bluntPencil": "Blunt Pencil",
  "bluntPencilDescription": "The blunt pencil, on the other hand, has a larger surface area at the tip, which spreads out the force more evenly over the silica. This reduces the risk of breaking the silica, allowing for smoother drawing or marking.",

  "inconsistentApplicationOfForce": "Inconsistent Application of Force:",
  "inconsistentApplicationOfForceDescription": "A sharp pencil applies a concentrated force, which can lead to uneven pressure on the silica. This inconsistency may damage specific areas, creating unwanted grooves or cracks.",
  "lossOfPrecisionWithBluntPencil": "Loss of Precision with a Blunt Pencil:",
  "lossOfPrecisionWithBluntPencilDescription": "While the blunt pencil doesn't damage the silica, it might lack the precision required for fine details or accurate lines.

  "usageInTLCDescription": "In TLC, a small amount of a sample is applied to the bottom of the silica plate (the 'spotting'). The plate is then placed in a solvent (mobile phase), which travels up the plate by capillary action, carrying the components of the sample with it. Depending on how strongly each component interacts with the silica, they move at different rates and separate.",
